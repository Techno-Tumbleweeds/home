        <h2> Hardware</h2>

        <p>When we started working on the robot, we often started with a complex and lofty design with everything that we thought was needed. Then we realized that it is best to start with a simple design that we can improve upon. We have had many iterations to many components of our robot this year.
            A large amount of integrations was made to the arm this year. We started the arm with a vertical lift design, which we used for the scrimmages that we went to. After realizing that a homemade lift doesn’t have good speed and we could not pick pixels up reliably with it. We decided to change our arm design to a similar design that we have seen on other FTC robots. Our next arm was going to have a claw that lowered on an angular bar to grab pixels from the intake on the bottom. We quickly realized there were flaws in our design and decided to keep the angular bar, but not the lift system. We wanted to keep our original intake at first. The intake was under the robot and we used our arm to reach under and grab the pixels. This sparked the creation of our current design which is an arm with a claw attached to the end of an angular bar. Instead of having the intake on the inside, we have the claw reach outside of the robot and put what we call a plow on the end of the robot to ensure that pixels don’t get stuck inside the robot.
            We have also iterated our drone launcher many times this season. At our first scrimmage, we put together a large drone launcher. It didn’t work well because of it’s size and because the components were difficult to put on the robot. We then 3D-printed a Drone Launcher that was similar to our previous design. We changed the placement of the launcher several times to accommodate our arm design.
            Our current robot design is a simple rectangular chassis with horizontal drivetrain. Our arm is a horizontal lift on an axel raised 11.5 inches from the ground. The max height is 25.25 inches. The intake is simply a claw, powered by two servos, that can grab two pixels. 
            We have what we call the “pooper scooper” on the front of our robot to make sure that pixels don’t get stuck under the robot. The hubs are situated vertically on the end of the chassis opposite of the arm. The drone launcher is behind the arm on the left. The power switch is opposite the drone launcher.
            We ordered mecanum wheels, but they were not compatible with our robot parts, so we 3D printed a new compatible wheel core. At first we didn’t know how to make the wheels work with our robot parts, but we talked to team 11260, Up A Creek. and they suggested that we print our own wheel core. 
            Another innovative part of our robot is the way we used math to keep our design simple. We realized that if we raised the arm 60 degrees it would align perfectly with the backdrop. We discussed with the idea of a counter weight but realized that we would have to have 5 times the weight to balance out our lever arm because the arm was too long. 
            We originally started with a worm gear drive train, but decided to switch. The worm gears could not support the whole weight of the robot and move the robot as well. We decided to have the motors hooked straight to the wheels, which can give us more speed in both Autonomous and TeleOp.</p>
