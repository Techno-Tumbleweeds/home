        <h1>Our Robot - Tom</h1>
        <hr class="custom-line">
        <h3> Hardware</h3>

        <p>When we started working on the robot, we often started with a complex and lofty design with everything that we thought was needed. Then we realized that it is best to start with a simple design that we can improve upon. We have had many iterations to many components of our robot this year.
        <p>A large amount of integrations was made to the arm this year. We started the arm with a vertical lift design, which we used for the scrimmages that we went to. After realizing that a homemade lift doesn’t have good speed and we could not pick pixels up reliably with it. We decided to change our arm design to a similar design that we have seen on other FTC robots. Our next arm was going to have a claw that lowered on an angular bar to grab pixels from the intake on the bottom. We quickly realized there were flaws in our design and decided to keep the angular bar, but not the lift system. We wanted to keep our original intake at first. The intake was under the robot and we used our arm to reach under and grab the pixels. This sparked the creation of our current design which is an arm with a claw attached to the end of an angular bar. Instead of having the intake on the inside, we have the claw reach outside of the robot and put what we call a plow on the end of the robot to ensure that pixels don’t get stuck inside the robot.</p>
        <p>We have also iterated our drone launcher many times this season. At our first scrimmage, we put together a large drone launcher. It didn’t work well because of it’s size and because the components were difficult to put on the robot. We then 3D-printed a Drone Launcher that was similar to our previous design. We changed the placement of the launcher several times to accommodate our arm design.</p>
        <p>Our current robot design is a simple rectangular chassis with horizontal drivetrain. Our arm is a horizontal lift on an axel raised 11.5 inches from the ground. The max height is 25.25 inches. The intake is simply a claw, powered by two servos, that can grab two pixels. </p>
        <p>We have what we call the “pooper scooper” on the front of our robot to make sure that pixels don’t get stuck under the robot. The hubs are situated vertically on the end of the chassis opposite of the arm. The drone launcher is behind the arm on the left. The power switch is opposite the drone launcher.</p>
        <p>We ordered mecanum wheels, but they were not compatible with our robot parts, so we 3D printed a new compatible wheel core. At first we didn’t know how to make the wheels work with our robot parts, but we talked to team 11260, Up A Creek. and they suggested that we print our own wheel core. </p>
        <p>Another innovative part of our robot is the way we used math to keep our design simple. We realized that if we raised the arm 60 degrees it would align perfectly with the backdrop. We discussed with the idea of a counter weight but realized that we would have to have 5 times the weight to balance out our lever arm because the arm was too long. </p>
        <p>We originally started with a worm gear drive train, but decided to switch. The worm gears could not support the whole weight of the robot and move the robot as well. We decided to have the motors hooked straight to the wheels, which can give us more speed in both Autonomous and TeleOp.</p>
    
        <h3> Attachments</h3>
        <p>All of our attachments have had the same design process as the rest of our robot: first we came up with a design and kept iterating it until we had the final product. We never view our robot as complete and realize that there are always improvements to be made. We started simple and improved. We started with an idea inspired by other teams, then adapted it to our needs and our chassis design and sizes. </p>
        <p>We got inspiration from other teams by seeing their robots work well and aspired to that goal. Looking at Engineering Portfolios from previous years helped us learn more about the process of designing. Our claw design is good at lifting pushing and dropping pixels on any surface we need. We also have a plow on the back of the robot to push pixels if our claw malfunctions during a match.</p>

        <h3> OnShape</h3>

            <p>The process of learning CAD was figuring out the basics. We developed our skills through CAD, many of us didn’t know how to operate CAD software at the beginning of the season, but through teamwork, we were able to learn and effectively design parts this season. We learned from watching other FTC teams and learning how to import parts from other sources. We used CAD to have a visual and mechanical idea of how we would make our design work. The builders were able to look at CAD to build proposed designs. This season we 3D printed many components of our robot such as our intake system and claw. We designed these parts in CAD before printing them. We also started doing more complicated things like using mate connectors that help the design to become more realistic, and we learned how to use a slicer, which converts the CAD design into a G-code file that the 3D printer can understand.</p>
            <p>We learned that CAD is very important and useful in the real world because we used CAD to design parts and adapters. Additionally, we learned how to visualize our designs through CAD without having to really assemble the robot.</p>

        <h3> Software</h3>

        <p>We learned a great amount about coding during this FTC season. A few goals that we had for this season included using Java, finding how to move, and to score points during a match in Autonomous. We found out how to move and we can score points during autonomous, but we decided not to use Java and use Java blocks instead. We chose to start with more basic codes and in future years, use more advanced code. We started the season by learning and being able to understand the Java blocks work. YouTube, FTCsim, and the FTC website’s coding documentation were all helpful. Then through trial and error, we learned how to code the type of robot that we have. One optical that we had was having four motors. We are used to two motors, because we competed in FLL. Once we figured out how to move with all four motors, we could start the rest of our codes.</p>

        <h4> TeleOp </h4>

        <p>For our movement in TeleOP, we add many different inputs from the controller and multiply that by some constant for speed, then, we set that number to each of the wheels, giving us fluid movement. We take different variables from our gamepad triggers and joysticks to move. Not all teams use triggers for movement, but it was more familiar for our drivers. We also added a button to change the speed constant for our robot, so for small adjustments, we don’t have to rely on human error, we can change the speed for finer adjustments with the force that we press the triggers.</p>

        <h4> Autonomus </h4>

        <p>The points scored during autonomous are increased. This is our motivation to have a consistent code. Our goal was to get at least get one pixel to the backdrop. One block in our code that we use for better performance and consistency is the ZeroPowerBehavior block. It helps us to help our motors to be more consistent by having the motor stop moving when it is not in use. We made functions with inputs for movement so we can change the distance and speed that our robot travels. This helps us be consistent during autonomous. </p>
